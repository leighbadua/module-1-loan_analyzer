## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create a Python program that automates, analyze, and perform financial calculations. Financial functions were created in order to calculate present values on loans and set up code on how to analyze new loans. By using csvwriter, we are able to save the results as a spreadsheet for the company's business analyst to use.
